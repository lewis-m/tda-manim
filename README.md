# tda-manim
Adding Topological Data Analysis (TDA) specific classes to manim.

Classes in this repo mostly inherit from manim.VGroup and can be added to manim Scenes.

Examples of classes include:

- Simplicial Complexes
- Filtrations of simplicial complexes
- Sweeping Plane Filtrations (plane animated as 'sweeping' over simplicial complex)
- Vietoris Rips & Chech Filtrations (animated with expanding balls)
- Animated Barcodes
- Animated ECT & SECT

Important classes have docstrings. Further documentation and examples are in planning.
